# SuperStore Sales Analysis

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze sales data from a fictional SuperStore in order to identify key trends, patterns, and opportunities for business improvement. The analysis will explore sales performance by region, product category, customer segment, and other relevant dimensions to answer important business questions such as:

- Which product categories and sub-categories are most profitable?
- What regions and customer segments drive the most sales?
- Are there shipping modes or discount patterns that negatively impact profit?
- Can we identify any trends that would inform inventory, marketing, or operational decisions?

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `SuperStoreOrders.csv`, which includes records of customer orders, sales, profit, shipping details, and customer information.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code
- Git / GitHub

## Status

Project is in early stages. Initial data inspection and cleaning complete.

## Next Steps

- Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Visualize sales and profit across key dimensions
- Identify insights and opportunities
- Document findings in a final notebook or dashboard
